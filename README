This distribution replaces the (badly named) builtin distribution.

This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not
really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so
small such that being individual extensions would be wasteful.

After unpacking the distribution, to install this module type
 
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install


This distribution provides the following functions

	min
	max
	minstr
	maxstr
	sum
	first
	reduce
	blessed
	reftype
	weaken (5.005_57 and above only)
	isweak (5.005_57 and above only)
	dualvar

If you do not have a C compiler then you can install a perl-only implementation,
except that the following functions will not be avaliable

  weaken, isweak, dualvar

This can be done with

        perl Makefile.PL -pm
        make
        make test
        make install
